Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Hospital Outcome Reporting

About:

The OHCA Hospital Outcome Report is provided to the local 
PCI/STEMI hospitals in the District of Columbia. The purpose of the report
is provide regular, standardized reporting on cardiac arrest cases 
transported to their facilities by D.C. Fire and EMS, and to offer insight
to the aggregated patient outcomes for their respective facilities. 


Data:

Data for the analysis come from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance
Survival (CARES) database, which is manually entered by D.C. Fire and EMS
personnel and specific coordinators at participating hospitals.


Reporting:

Reports will be generated on a quarterly basis, and will run approximately
30 days later to account for delays in reporting due to on-going patient
care. This allows for data to be mostly completed by the time the report
is created. 


Format:

Each report will be structured as follows:

- Aggregate of GWU, HUH, WHC
 - Count of patients by:
  * Total
  * Race
  * Gender
  * Race + Gender
  
 - Shockable vs. Non-Shockable Arrests
  * Counts of each
  * Survived to discharge
  * Cerebral Performance Categories (1-4)
  * Above metrics disaggregated by Race and Gender
 
 - ROSC vs. No-ROSC
  * Counts of each
  * Survived to discharge
  * Cerebral Performance Categories (1-4)
  * Above metrics disaggregated by Race and Gender
  
- Hospital Specific (same metrics as above)

### Data Extraction Process ###

Data for the report are pulled from the mycares.net website, using the the 
'CARES Advanced Search' and 'CQI Reporting' filter. Dates should be filtered
for the specific time frame that is needed; e.g., the previous 3-months.
Once the date parameters have been specified, the 'report' can be searched. Upon
completion, select the option 'Excel export of data' to extract the data into 
a spreadsheet.

Once the data has been extract, a number of columns will need to be to remove
spaces that are in blank cells. Once cleaned and spaces removed from blank
cells, the data file should be saved as a .csv file with the following format:

'cares_YYYY_q#.csv', where YYYY is a 4-digit year, and # is the calendar year
Quarter number
