DCRC QI Charts Notes:

Date: 2021-10-22

The dcrc_qi_charts scripts serves as the foundation for the essential quality control charts that will be used for the DCRC. The following 
metrics, beyond the survival metrics, include:

# 3) AED Usage
# 4) Shockable Rhythm
# 5) Bystander/Family Member CPR
# 6) ROSC Rates
# 7) End of Event Data (transport data)
# 8) ED Resuscitation Data

System Measures:
Each of the above metrics are considered, for the purposes of the DCRC, are considered system level measures. System level measures are measures of key inputs that have known, or suspected impacts on survival from sudden cardiac arrest. What follows is a rationale of each metric, and theories of what we expect to see.



3) AED Usage

Rationale: 
AED usage is a critical intervention in an effort to improve survival from sudden cardiac arrest because of the ability to deliver early defibrillation in 'shockable' rhythm cases.

Theories:
- Increased usage of AEDs will correspond with increases in the number of patients with a first monitored rhythm found to be 'shockable'

- Increased usage of AEDs will correspond with efforts to improve access throughout the communities

- Increased usage of AEDS will correspond with efforts to improve use by First Responders (MPD) and by FEMS BLS units



4) Shockable Rhythms

Rationale:
Shockable rhythms, which are either Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT), are lethal if left untreated, and if treated early with electrical therapy delivered by an AED or Monitor/Defibrillator, have a high probability of conversion to a perfusing, organized rhythm. Currently, these cases make up approximately 10% of all cardiac arrests treated by DC FEMS. An increase in the number of shockable arrests may be a lagging indicator of improved recognition, early deployment of AEDs, and higher rates of bystander CPR. 

Theories:
- Increased rates of 'shockable' first monitored rhythms may indicate earlier recognition of cardiac arrest

- Increased rates of 'shockable' first monitored rhythms may be a lagging indicator of the quality of bystander interventions; e.g., high quality bystander CPR.

- Increased rates of 'shockable' first monitored rhythms may be a lagging indicator of First Responder/EMS Response and AED used/deployement
